In this repository, I am working on making the profile page of Instagram in Jetpack Compose. The app's UI is divided into various sections, such as TopBar, Profile image, status, and description, Story Highlightes, Buttons for email and messages, and Tab View. 

📝Jetpack Compose is considered modern toolkit for building native Android UI. In Jetpack Compose, we build apps which covers simple UI components with declarative functions, called composable functions or composables for short. These functions let developers define the android apps' UI programmatically by just describing how they should be look and providing data dependencies. Therefore, we won't need need to edit any XML layouts or we don't use the Layout Editor anymore. 

📝I have applied the following concepts in the process of creating Instagram Profile UI with Jetpack Compose:

     📌Layouts (Column Row)
     📌Text Styles (we apply them because of a paragraph of text for profile description)
