📝Jetpack Compose is considered modern toolkit for building native Android UI. In Jetpack Compose, we build apps which covers simple UI components with declarative functions, called composable functions or composables for short. These functions let developers define the android apps' UI programmatically by just describing how they should be look and providing data dependencies. Therefore, we won't need need to edit any XML layouts or we don't use the Layout Editor anymore. 

📝In this repository, I am working on making the profile page of Instagram in Jetpack Compose. The layout arrangement of the app consists of various sections, such as TopBar, Profile image and status together in one section, Profile description, Story Highlightes in another section, Buttons section for editing and sharing profile, and Tab View (meant for switching the tabs. The overall UI of the app is a big column of everything.
